\# Desktop Client



Use Tauri for the desktop app unless there is a strong reason not to.



Client responsibilities:

\- Detect and validate the ESO AddOns folder

\- Scan installed addons by reading manifest `.txt` files

\- Parse addon name, version, author, and dependency declarations

\- Install ZIP files directly into the AddOns folder

\- Update addons by replacing their folder contents

\- Show installed addons, missing dependencies, and update status

\- Refresh metadata on app open and with a manual button



Implementation notes:

\- Keep filesystem logic in the Tauri backend

\- Keep UI logic in the frontend

\- Store only enough local state to remember installed addons and their source IDs

\- Make path override possible for nonstandard installs



MVP UI:

\- Installed addons list

\- Addon detail panel

\- Install by ESOUI URL or ID

\- Refresh button

\- Update all button

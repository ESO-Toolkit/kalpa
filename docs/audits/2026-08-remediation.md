## Decisions

### D-W1-1 — Durable Object storage is mutation authority

- Chosen: store canonical packs as per-ID records in the existing SQLite-backed `PackIndexDO`; rewrite the unchanged KV index/detail read model from canonical state after each mutation.
- Create uniqueness and author caps run inside the DO gate. Updates merge editable content into the canonical record and preserve DO-owned identity/counters. Missing records are never reconstructed from caller-provided KV bodies.
- Rejected: continuing to treat KV as authoritative. KV can return a stale index even when DO RPCs are serialized, so tombstones alone or merely removing seed healing cannot prevent all lost updates.
- Rejected: one serialized DO index value. Per-ID records avoid a single-value growth ceiling and make existence/uniqueness point lookups.
- Compatibility: successful response fields and the KV `PackIndex`/`Pack` shapes are unchanged; duplicate create uses the existing `{ error: string }` error shape with HTTP 409.
- Rollout caveat: the first post-deploy bootstrap must import the existing KV index. A quiet/controlled rollout or an explicit bootstrap mechanism must be chosen before merge because the freshest KV read can still lag a just-completed pre-deploy mutation.

### D-W1-2 — Continuously merged shadow with a parity-gated authority flip

- Chosen: default the durable `meta:authority` flag to `kv`, re-read and additively merge the KV index on every serialized mutation, and keep per-id tombstones so stale KV cannot restore deletions. DO records win once present. During shadow mode, list and backup reads use the merged DO view, while mutations update only affected KV detail keys; they do not overwrite the full KV index from a potentially incomplete shadow. After the parity-gated flip, the DO resumes full KV-index mirroring with the unchanged wire shape.
- The first deployment is the shadow/backfill phase. After at least one post-deploy daily backup, an operator must observe two clean parity reads more than 60 seconds apart before explicitly switching authority to `do`.
- Parity uses D1 ids, `backup:latest`, and enumerated `pack:<id>` detail keys as independent witnesses. Missing untombstoned ids block the flip. The admin-only adoption endpoint can recover a specifically adjudicated id from its independently propagated KV detail record; it never adopts D1 rows automatically because a failed historical D1 delete can be a zombie.
- Rejected: one-shot or timed bootstrap gates. KV provides no bounded propagation time, and an auto-deployed maintenance gate would create operator-bounded mutation downtime without proving completeness.
- Rejected: all dated backups as live witnesses. Their intentional 90-day retention includes deleted packs and would make parity impossible; only a post-deploy `backup:latest` represents the current corpus.
- Rollback: shadow-mode mutations deliberately do not rewrite the full KV index, so rolling back to old code can omit post-deploy creates from listings even though their detail and D1 rows survive. Any rollback after this deployment therefore requires a verified backup/DO export restore; changing the flag alone is not a reconciliation strategy.

 ### D-W1-3 — Journal lifecycle transitions and serve detail from DO authority

- Chosen after the twice-reject Fable reconsultation: commit canonical lifecycle state together with a deterministic operation journal and per-pack pending marker, then resume idempotent KV vote/detail, D1, and full-index effects on retry and by Durable Object alarm.
- Delete commits the tombstone before destructive cleanup, so partial vote cleanup cannot coexist with a live pack. Same-owner retry resumes pending cleanup; slug reuse is refused until the old lifecycle finishes.
- Create retry by the same actor resumes the stored canonical create instead of returning duplicate. Success is acknowledged only after the KV detail step; an incomplete mirror returns a retryable failure while public detail reads use the DO and remain consistent with canonical lifecycle state.
- Unowned shadow records reconcile against newer KV detail by `updated_at`; an ownership latch prevents stale KV from overwriting DO mutations. Version disagreement is exposed as `stale_shadow` and blocks the authority flip.
 - Rejected: external-effects-first compensation, because the compensating store can fail and a crash can leave an unowned orphan; pending markers without operation identity or alarms, because retries cannot be safely attributed and cleanup may remain stuck indefinitely.

 ### D-R8-1 — Disclose missing coverage without blocking updates

- Chosen: treat an absent, corrupt, or folder-mismatched `.kalpa-hashes` manifest as no trusted Protected Edits baseline and disclose that Kalpa cannot detect changed files before mutation. Updates remain enabled because no explicit blocking policy was chosen.
- React manual, selected, batch, context-menu, and launch-auto-update flows share explicit coverage state. Batch coverage is refreshed at action time and published only while its captured instance generation and AddOns path remain current. The context shortcut opens the detail review flow, whose conflict report supplies the freshest single-addon baseline status.
- Shipped Slint single and batch flows re-read manifests at action time, display the same specific risk, and never label unprotected updates “safe.”
- Rejected: silently creating a trusted baseline from a migrated addon's existing files. Those files may already contain user edits, so seeding requires separate design review.
- Rejected: blocking migrated addons from updating. That changes product policy beyond the audit's minimum acceptable fix.
 - Compatibility: wire fields are additive and serde-defaulted; persisted metadata and hash-manifest formats are unchanged.

## Session Log

### 2026-08-27 — W1 twice-reject escalation

- PR #369 was returned to draft after review identified four additional correctness failures: stale KV versions can be frozen by ID-only shadow merging; partial vote cleanup can corrupt a still-live pack; a failed KV detail deletion is not retryable after the DO tombstone commits; and a failed KV detail write leaves a committed create that retries as a duplicate.
- Per the twice-reject rule, W1 is blocked and implementation is paused while Fable is reconsulted with both prior Sol reviews and the new review evidence.
- Fable selected D-W1-3: journaled and resumable lifecycle transitions, tombstone-first delete, DO-authoritative detail reads, version-aware shadow reconciliation, and alarm-based effect repair.
- Fresh Sol review returned `REVISE` with four findings: orphan detail adoption during account purge; stale same-author operations crossing slug reuse; vote/install counters committing before a fallible KV mirror; and a backup write racing account deletion. The single prescribed follow-up also returned `REVISE` after verifying those cases.
- Addressed every follow-up finding with author-scoped orphan hydration, created-at lifecycle compare-and-swap for update/delete, durable dirty-mirror markers repaired by alarm, and DO-serialized backup/account deletion guarded by a deleted-author latch. Added exact failure/retry regressions.
- Final local evidence: Worker TypeScript check passes; all 184 tests pass; Wrangler dry-run passes; `wrangler.toml` remains `kalpa-pack-hub`. No deploy, merge, schema change, or Worker rename was performed.

### 2026-08-26 — Codex

- Active branch: `fix/audit-w1-worker-consistency`
- Completed: read repository guidance, master prompt, and audit memory; fetched and fast-forward checked `main`; created the persistent tracker; started Kalpa successfully in Tauri dev mode; completed the W1 Fable review; captured five failing-before DO tests; implemented DO-authoritative mutations; added route-level duplicate, stale-update, and delete/vote race coverage; Worker typecheck and 159 tests pass.
- Active work: W1 PR maintainer review after addressing every verified finding from the initial and follow-up Sol reviews.
- Completed follow-up: Fable selected the continuously merged shadow design in D-W1-2. Implemented lifecycle guards for vote/install, canonical update/delete authorization, atomic restore preservation, deleted-pack vote cleanup (including `backup:latest`), repeated KV backfill with tombstones, parity-gated authority control, and explicit detail-witness adoption. Worker typecheck, 168 tests, and Wrangler dry-run pass; `wrangler.toml` remains `kalpa-pack-hub`.
- Sol follow-up: `REVISE`. Verified an incomplete-shadow full-index clobber, scheduled-backup reintroduction of another user's vote on a deleted pack, and delete/recreate vote-cleanup interleaving. Addressed by suppressing full-index writes during shadow mode, serving merged list/backup reads from the DO, filtering backup votes by deleted pack id, and moving vote cleanup inside the serialized delete lifecycle. Added the three requested regressions; Worker typecheck and 170 tests pass.
- Handoff: pushed `fix/audit-w1-worker-consistency` and opened PR [#369](https://github.com/ESO-Toolkit/kalpa/pull/369). All three GitHub CI jobs pass. No merge or deployment was performed; unrelated local `Cargo.toml` and theme-directory changes remain excluded.
- Blockers: no implementation or CI blockers remain. Maintainer approval is still required because merge auto-deploys the Worker shadow phase. The authority flip remains a separate operator step after soak/parity checks.
- Exact next action: maintainer reviews and merges PR #369 after accepting the shadow-mode rollback caveat, then monitors the production parity/authority-flip runbook.

### Sol review 1 — REVISE

Verified findings:

1. First post-deploy bootstrap can permanently omit a live pack when KV returns a stale index.
2. A stale vote/install request can cross delete-and-recreate and mutate the new pack lifecycle.
3. Update/delete authorization still trusts stale KV ownership rather than canonical DO ownership.
4. Restore finalization preserves concurrent packs from KV instead of atomically from DO authority.
5. Account deletion leaves other users' vote records attached to removed pack IDs, so a reused ID can inherit votes.

Wire contract verdict: OK. Bug-class sweep found the restore and account-deletion sites above.

### 2026-08-26 — R8 Protected Edits disclosure

- Active branch: `fix/audit-r8-protected-edits-disclosure`, stacked on `fix/audit-w1-worker-consistency`.
- Decision: D-R8-1 selects honest, specific, non-blocking disclosure and explicitly excludes baseline seeding from migrated files.
- Implementation: added defaulted baseline-presence fields to installed-addon and conflict-report contracts; rejected corrupt/mismatched manifests; added persistent React and Slint warning hierarchy; ordered automatic updates after coverage scans; refreshed React batch and native single/batch coverage at action time; routed the context shortcut through fresh detail preflight; removed native “safe” claims.
- Sol initial: `REVISE`. Verified the context-menu legacy bypass, launch auto-update race, ignored fresh single-update report, and corrupt-manifest validity. All four were addressed.
- Sol follow-up: `REVISE`. Verified remaining first-run ordering, cached action-time coverage, and dishonest native copy. All in-scope disclosure findings were addressed. The requested broader disk-only baseline redesign and dormant native auto-update preference wiring were excluded from R8 rather than silently expanding scope.
- Luna initial: `FAIL`. Verified that Review Update was pointer-only and that a late coverage scan could publish the old instance after a path switch. Added Context Menu / Shift+F10 access, focused menu active-descendant behavior, focus restoration, and generation/path-guarded reverse-resolution handling.
- Luna follow-up: `PASS`; `TOKEN_VIOLATIONS`, `ACCESSIBILITY`, `STATE_FEEDBACK`, and `RESPONSIVE_BEHAVIOR` all reported none.
- Evidence: `npm run check`; 40 frontend files / 497 tests; main Rust 809 passed / 17 ignored; Slint 757 passed / 15 ignored; main and Slint clippy with warnings denied; both fmt checks; native Slint release sidecar build; `git diff --check`.
- Handoff: pushed the branch and opened draft stacked PR [#381](https://github.com/ESO-Toolkit/kalpa/pull/381). No merge was performed.

## Open Questions

- W2: maintainer approval is required before merging any reconciliation path that can delete rows from shared D1.
- W1: decide whether moving vote-record authority from KV/in-memory memo into DO storage belongs in W1 or W3. The current W1 code prevents resurrection but retains the pre-existing eviction/double-toggle limitation for later hardening.
- W1: owner sign-off is required before the later manual `kv` → `do` authority flip and must accept backup restore as the post-flip rollback path.
- P0-A2: lock dependency and user-visible timeout behavior require a Fable recommendation and may require maintainer input.
- R4/R5: ownership/conflict behavior that changes install outcomes requires explicit design review before implementation.
- H2: `kalpa-elder-scrolls-themes/` is currently untracked; provenance must be inspected before tracking or ignoring it.
